# Network Monitoring Application
A Java-based application for monitoring the infrastructure of a website (firewall, database(s) and webserver(s)). Built for the NerdyGadgets project at Windesheim University of Applied Sciences in the "Object-Oriented Software Design & Development" semester during the second semester of the academic year of 2021-2022.

All code in this repository is open for use. Application is not originally designed for use in other contexts, however can be modified to make this happen.

## Built with
* Java 17 (+ Java Swing)
* Custom-made framework (present in `com.nerdygadgets.application.model`)
